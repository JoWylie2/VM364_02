# Better Than The Silence ReadMe

As BTTS is a much too large file for Github, you can access the application on my dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j98q70fb780yz7q/AADn0WghGI_J0gVfyCAalL34a?dl=0) and on my google drive [here] (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0ZbmfZwcXEQZzFyOFlRYzdhN2c&authuser=0).

The music for my unity project is also too big to upload to my unity project. The **MUSIC** folder
can be found in it's entirety in [this] (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7nwl37u5jndy90g/AAAVA_QiY58pttd9gjnCCDuaa?dl=0) dropbox folder. Drag the folder labeled **MUSIC** into the
**Assets** folder of the unity project, without unpacking anything, and all the audio files should be
placed. This folder holds not only the music for the game, but also the audio that drives the narrative. **please take the time
to download the audio if you intend to look at the game in Unity. The driving narrative cannot work without it.**
