For my event, I went to the Northeastern Annual Showcase of Games. We explored 
some really interesting games, and had a lot of fun talking to the student creators of
varying skill and style. A few images from the event can be found on the [presentation I used to present my experience in class](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17OkxaXfvtS9uxBBXyKD9j33tU3UqG56LzEcnYz92-2A/edit?usp=sharing

There was a whole bunch of really interesting games showcased at the event. The first we explored
was **Cupid Kerfuffle**, which the creators later described as coming about when they decided
they wanted to create a game that was a "cross between *Tinder* and *papers Please*". I loved the 
imagination behind that kind of creative process, and the final game was a lot of fun.

The creators of Cupid Kerfuffle were also interesting to talk to because they mentioned that
one of the big mistakes they made was try to force their idea onto a specific piece of hardware.
They had to put a lot of time into stripping down their idea of all the cool additions and 
doohickeys to create a simple and fun game, and advised against trying to make things too
complicated just because you can.

A second game that was really interesting was Blight Crusaders, another of the capstone projects at the event. The
creators of this game had run into a *lot* of hurdles, and their game had suffered in a 
number of areas. The greatest takeaway I took from their talk was that their biggest failure,
in their eyes, was not meeting face-to-face. They found themselves unable to work together using
only facebook chat and skype, and their biggest advice definitely seemed to be to work 
together, as a team, from early on, and have regular in-person check ins.

This became something of a theme for the whole evening. Many groups either lauded their team for
being able to remain cohesive, or said that a lack of cohesion was where their project failed. 
The second half of the event was also a panel with a few members of Harmonix, including Jonathan Mintzis, a Senior Designer, Ryan Lesser the Art Director for Harmonix for 15 years and now Creative Lead for the new PlayStation title, Amplitude,
Greg LoPiccolo, the Project Director for Thief: The Dark Project and Project Director for FreQuency, Amplitude, Guitar Hero 1, Rock Band 1, and Chroma, and Chris Foster,
who was lead designer for The Beatles: Rock Band, Project Lead for Green Day: Rock Band, and Lead Content Designer for The Lord of the Rings Online.
A lot of fun stories and good advice came from the panel, but the stuff that stuck with me the most - probably paired with the warnings of
the students at the event - was on teamwork. The speaker leading the panel asked for the most valuable skill they had learned since entering
into the game industry, and one of the best answers was as follows; that there is no specific skill
that is more valuable than the ability to set aside your ego, and your sense of the Auteur,
and harness and channel the idea of those around you. One of the big reasons I want to get
into video games is that it seems the most communal, team-oriented creative industry I have an interest in,
and the Harmonix panel only encouraged that line of thought.
