# Duet: The Physical Game

Duet was conceived after being given the brief to create a physical game based on the iOS game Duet by Kumobius.

We went through a number of iterations in creating the game.

### Iteration 1
The first iteration was to have four people playing the game; two players - the ‘on team’ - and the then a reader and timekeeper - the ‘off team’. 
* The off team was trying to knock the on-team over within the time limit (one minute), while the on-team was trying to make it to the end of the timer.
* One member of the on-team would be blindfolded, to increase the sense of unity created in Duet, as the on-team had to communicate.
* Play began on the board.
* Every 5 moves, the blindfolded player switched.
We built the deck of cards, which consisted at the time of:
* 4 Color/limb cards (i.e. Right Foot on Blue)
* 4 Limb change cards (i.e. swap right and left feet)
* 4 Color switch cards (switch 2 colors of your choice)
* 4 Remove color cards (Remove all blue tiles)

### Iteration 2
In the second iteration, we stopped swapping the blindfolded player, swapping who was blindfolded between each 1 minute round.

### Iteration 3
To balance the number of colored tiles on the board, we had to make the center tile black. We decided to put it to use. We named it a “sticky” tile; at any point if a player couldn’t reach the color he was supposed to reach, he could chose to use the sticky tile instead. However, that leg or hand couldn’t be moved until the round was over - it was now “stuck”.
Through a collection of playtests this because evidently a useless mechanic. We didn’t think to use it at any point, and swiftly had to throw it out.

### Iteration 4
We stopped holding hands. Instead the game started with the two players with opposite hands on the middle tile.
We times a lot of playtests and realised that people could always stay upright after a minute of play. Thus, we abolished the timer, making the game go just until the players fell over.

### Iteration 5
We changed the central mechanic so that the two teams (for ease of explanation, say, red and blue team.) each had a player on the board and a reader. The two readers alternate reading, but players listen to both readers. This brought in a tactic mechanic as the readers had to chose if they protect their own player or target the other team’s.
The four “Remove color” cards were removed, and “color swap” cards were reduced to only 2 in the deck.

## Duet: A game for two teams of two
### Setup
Your first time playing, set the board up in the following design:

### How to play
1. Choose two readers and two players. Board players place feet at edge of board and each place their alternate hands on the middle square. 
2. Reading players pick up 3 cards each, and maintain 3 cards in their hand at all times.
3. Youngest reader begins by reading a color-appendage combination card (ex. Right foot blue) for both players to follow that instruction.
4. Gameplay continues by reading players alternating calling cards for both players to obey.
5. The game goes on until someone falls down or misplaces their appendage. It’s the job of the opposing team to notice and call out where applicable.
6. As you get more familiar with the board and the game, Feel free to mix up the board design to keep players on their toes (and fingers!). These are two particularly challenging board set ups to try out:

As we tested out different board variations, we discovered that having pairs of color next to each other made for an easier game than the colors equally disperse throughout. This was clearly a bell curve, however - clumping the colors all together on the four sides of the board made for a much harder game!
