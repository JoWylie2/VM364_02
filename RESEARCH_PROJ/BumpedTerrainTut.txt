# Bumped Terrain

##Creating a terrain with a bump map.

My research project into how to create a terrain with a bump map. I had a project that had
 a cracked, broken road that looks particularly flat when building

 This was the image I was using on this terrain, as a diffuse material as a texture brush.
 It was an image of cracked dirt, offset in the usual way to tile it, and then with the road 
 lines painted on with photoshop. Very simple.

I had to create a bump map for the tile. I created the bump map using the already grayscale 
cracked road texture. 

Once you import the tiles into Unity, in the import settings dialoge, select "Alpha from Grayscale".

However, saving this image separately and putting it into unity has no
effect at this point.

You first have to create a new material. Make this material a Nature>Terrain>Bumped Specular material.
For now, leave the specular color and shininess at their automatic settings. You can edit this later
to your desire.

In your terrain settings, place your new bumped material into the "Material" option.

Paint your terrain! The terrain should now be bumped, reacting to your light source and the player movement.
